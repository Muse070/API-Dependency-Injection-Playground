# API-Dependency-Injection-Playground

In this project, I play around with both Retrofit and Ktor which a client side Api integration tools.
I also use dependency injection made possible by using daggger-hilt 2 with both retrofit and ktor in a way that it is easy to interchange between whichever tool
the developer prefers to use.

The project is meant to be very simple and serves as a means to understand how View Models, Api Interfaces, DTO's and 
Dependency work together while making use of  MVVM clean architecture to get the work done.
